Someone needs to be port forwarded. Alternatively, ssh into a unix server hosted by CMU. This is because y'all probably aren't on the same network and can't access each other's computers directly, instead having to go through the router.
1. Make one of you ssh into the server and copy the asciiZOOMserver.py file into a directory. Fix the UDP_IP variable inside the file to reflect the specific unix machine you ended up in.
2. Both of you locally need to have a copy of asciifyimage.py and asciiZOOM.py, and change the variable UDP_IP inside to be the specific unix machine the server is running on.
3. Also, the local python must have opencv2 installed (the command is "pip install opencv-python"). The application you're running the python from (terminal or powershell or an IDE) needs to have webcam access granted as well, which they'll usually prompt you about
4. Run the asciiZOOM.server.py on the server
5. Each of you run the asciiZOOM.py file locally. 
6. Congrats! Now you can see each other through a secure, DIY terminal connection instead of relying on Zoom's insecure, fake-encrypted crappy video chat. 
7. Oh you want audio now? And chat feature? Kids today are so greedy... Use discord or something, if y'all made it this far I'm sure you can figure it out.
